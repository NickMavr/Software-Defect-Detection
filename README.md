Introduction

Software defects can lead to critical failures in applications, impacting users and businesses. This project explores various machine learning techniques to predict software defects based on historical and contextual data.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project includes features extracted from software metrics, such as: Code Complexity Metrics Change History Metrics Team-related Metrics

Data Preprocessing:

The following steps were applied to preprocess the dataset:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing duplicates.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for defect detection.

Normalization/Scaling: Ensuring numerical features are scaled appropriately.

Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Gradient Boosting Machines

Neural Networks

Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.

Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.

Recall: Ability to identify all relevant instances.

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

AUC-ROC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

Results: A detailed comparison of models and their performance metrics is provided in the notebook.
